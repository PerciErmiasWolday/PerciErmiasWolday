# Hey there, I'm Perci   

Welcome to my corner of the internet! Here, you'll find a collection of my coding adventures, experiments, and the occasional “aha!” moments captured in lines of code. I'm a Full Stack Developer who thrives at the intersection of creativity and logic—building solutions that don’t just work but also *feel* right.

## **When I'm not Coding**
I'm likely,   
Diving into sci-fi books or geeking out about space exploration.
Binging tech podcasts to stay ahead of the curve.
Plotting my next big project while sipping coffee that’s 90% too strong.
Trying (and failing) to keep my plants alive—they deserve better, really.
